Repo containing API implementation for Project 1: Integration.

## API Implementation Notes
Our API Implementation functions are as follows: Once a command to parse the API is called in REPL, an API aggregator is instantiated in order to get data from the API output, there are cases in the API aggregator to ensure that there isn't any error and that the data is correct, a json is then instantiated to convert the data to a list.
